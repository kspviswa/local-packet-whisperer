## Contributions

I just created this project based on inspiration from similar project called [Packet Buddy](https://github.com/automateyournetwork/packet_buddy) which used open AI. But if you find this useful and wanna contribute bug fixes, additional features feel free to do so by raising a PR or open issues for me to fix. I intend to work on this as a hobby unless there is some interest in the community.
